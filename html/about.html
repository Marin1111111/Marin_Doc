            <p>Marin (Ming) Zhang based in New York provides fashion photography for a variety of clients. As part of recent work for her Master’s in Digital Photography from the city’s prestigious School of Visual Arts, Zhang, who also offers retouching and web design, employed the visual language of fashion to create a fine-art essay called Fantasy Gods.   A series of studio-based fashion photographs that feature models clothed and styled to appear godlike, the project explores the idea that the relationship between deities and human beings.   Zhang’s other creative pursuits include documantary photography, work that was exhibited this year at New York’s annual Photoville festival.</p>
